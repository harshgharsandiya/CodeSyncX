# CodeSyncX

- Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor with AI and Communication Features

## Project Overview

- CodeSyncX is a web-based platform that allows developers, students, and teams to collaboratively write, edit, and run code in real-time. It combines the power of live code collaboration with video/voice chat, screen sharing, and AI-powered code assistance.

Think of it as Google Docs for coding, where multiple users can interact, code, and communicate simultaneously.
